The FAQ Chatbot successfully demonstrates how NLP and machine learning can automate question answering. It provides quick, accurate, and consistent responses through an easy-to-use chat interface.

This project aims to develop a chatbot that can automatically respond to Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) related to a particular topic or product. The chatbot uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand user queries and provide accurate answers. It matches user input with a predefined list of questions and retrieves the most relevant response. By using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity, the chatbot ensures intelligent matching between user queries and stored FAQs.
